### Boost Source-Level Security Analysis

Last Updated: Tuesday, September 26, 2023 at 9:57:00 AM PDT

1. **Severity**: 8/10

   **Line Number**: 6

   **Bug Type**: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

   **Description**: The function 'update_user' is directly using the 'user_id' from the request to update the user. This can lead to unauthorized users being able to modify other users' data if they can guess or brute-force the 'user_id'. More about IDOR can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control

   **Solution**: Implement proper access control checks to ensure the user making the request has the necessary permissions to update the data. This could be done by checking if the 'user_id' in the session matches the 'user_id' in the request, or by implementing roles and permissions in your application. More about access control can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control


2. **Severity**: 9/10

   **Line Number**: 13

   **Bug Type**: SQL Injection

   **Description**: The function 'get_user' is using string concatenation to create the SQL query. This can lead to SQL Injection if an attacker can control the 'user_id' value. More about SQL Injection can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A1_2017-Injection

   **Solution**: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection. This ensures that user input is always treated as literal data and not part of the SQL command.

### Boost Source-Level Performance Analysis

Last Updated: Tuesday, September 26, 2023 at 9:59:01 AM PDT

1. **Severity**: 6/10

   **Line Number**: 2

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The code is creating a new instance of BufferedReader for every line of input. This can lead to excessive memory usage if the input is large.

   **Solution**: Move the creation of the BufferedReader outside of the while loop. This way, only one instance is created and used throughout the loop. Here is a resource that might help: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reading-input-from-console-in-java-using-bufferedreader-class/


2. **Severity**: 7/10

   **Line Number**: 4

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The code is using a regular expression to split the input string into an array. This can be CPU intensive for large inputs.

   **Solution**: Consider using a more efficient method to split the string, such as the split() method of the String class. Here is a resource that might help: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/split-string-java-examples/


3. **Severity**: 5/10

   **Line Number**: 6

   **Bug Type**: Memory

   **Description**: The code is creating a new ArrayList for every line of input. This can lead to excessive memory usage if the input is large.

   **Solution**: Consider reusing the same ArrayList for each line of input. Clear the list at the beginning of each loop iteration. Here is a resource that might help: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arraylist-in-java/


4. **Severity**: 6/10

   **Line Number**: 8

   **Bug Type**: CPU

   **Description**: The code is using a nested for loop to compare each word with every other word. This is an O(n^2) operation and can be CPU intensive for large inputs.

   **Solution**: Consider using a more efficient data structure such as a Set to store the words. This will allow you to check for duplicates in O(1) time. Here is a resource that might help: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashset-in-java/


5. **Severity**: 5/10

   **Line Number**: 10

   **Bug Type**: Disk

   **Description**: The code is writing to the disk for every word that is found to be a duplicate. This can be disk intensive for large inputs.

   **Solution**: Consider buffering the output and writing to the disk in larger chunks. This can reduce the number of disk writes and improve performance. Here is a resource that might help: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bufferedwriter-class-in-java/
