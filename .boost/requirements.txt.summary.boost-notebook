The project is using exact versions of dependencies, which might not include the latest security patches. This could potentially lead to the application being vulnerable to known security issues in these dependencies. This issue was found in the 'requirements.txt' file.\n\n- The risk associated with this issue is high, as it could potentially expose the software to known security vulnerabilities. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents that could have severe consequences for the organization and its customers.\n\nPotential Customer Impact:\n\n- Customers could be affected by this issue if a security vulnerability is exploited. This could lead to unauthorized access to customer data, disruption of service, and loss of trust in the organization.\n\nOverall Issues:\n\n- The overall health of the source code is at risk due to the dependency management issue. This issue was found in the 'requirements.txt' file, which is a critical file in the project as it manages all the dependencies.\n\n- The issue is of 'Warning' severity, indicating that it needs immediate attention. \n\nRoot Cause Analysis:\n\n- The root cause of this issue is a lack of developer education on secure dependency management practices. \n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. Provide training to developers on secure dependency management practices. This should include using a version range that allows for the latest security patches to be included.\n\n2. Implement a policy for regular updating and auditing of dependencies to ensure that they are up-to-date and secure.\n\n3. Use automated tools to check for outdated or insecure dependencies and alert developers when they are found.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The most severe issue found in the project is insecure dependency management in the 'requirements.txt' file.\n\n- This issue could potentially expose the software to known security vulnerabilities, leading to severe consequences such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and loss of customer trust.\n\n- The root cause of this issue is a lack of developer education on secure dependency management practices.\n\n- Recommended actions include providing developer training, implementing a policy for regular updating and auditing of dependencies, and using automated tools to check for outdated or insecure dependencies.",
