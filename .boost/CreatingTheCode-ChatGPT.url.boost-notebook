This can lead to unauthorized users being able to modify other users' data if they can guess or brute-force the 'user_id'. More about IDOR can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control\n\n   **Solution**: Implement proper access control checks to ensure the user making the request has the necessary permissions to update the data. This could be done by checking if the 'user_id' in the session matches the 'user_id' in the request, or by implementing roles and permissions in your application. More about access control can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control\n\n\n2. **Severity**: 9/10\n\n   **Line Number**: 13\n\n   **Bug Type**: SQL Injection\n\n   **Description**: The function 'get_user' is using string concatenation to create the SQL query. This can lead to SQL Injection if an attacker can control the 'user_id' value. More about SQL Injection can be found here: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A1_2017-Injection\n\n   **Solution**: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection. This ensures that user input is always treated as literal data and not part of the SQL command.

This can lead to excessive memory usage if the input is large.\n\n   **Solution**: Move the creation of the BufferedReader outside of the while loop. This way, only one instance is created and used throughout the loop.

This is an O(n^2) operation and can be CPU intensive for large inputs.\n\n   **Solution**: Consider using a more efficient data structure such as a Set to store the words.
