This project is designed to process customer orders from an Excel sheet using the OpenAI GPT API. The README file provides detailed instructions on how to setup and use this project.\n\nHere's a summary of the steps:\n\n1. **Clone the repository:** This step involves copying the project from the remote repository to the local machine. The command `git clone https://github.com/your-username/AIBoostedOrderProcessing.git` is used to clone the repository. The user needs to replace `your-username` with their actual GitHub username.\n\n2. **Navigate to the repository:** The `cd AIBoostedOrderProcessing` command is used to change the current directory to the project's directory.\n\n3. **Create a virtual environment:** Pythonâ€™s virtual environments are used to isolate project-specific dependencies from the global Python environment. The `python -m venv venv` command is used to create a new virtual environment named `venv`.\n\n4. **Activate the virtual environment:** This step involves activating the virtual environment that was just created. The command to activate the virtual environment varies based on the operating system.\n\n5. **Install the requirements:** The `pip install -r requirements.txt` command is used to install the Python dependencies required for this project. These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.\n\n6. **Run the Script:** The `python src/aiBoostedOrderProcessor.py <OpenAI_API_KEY> <path_to_excel_file.xlsx>` command is used to run the script. Two command-line arguments are required: the OpenAI GPT API key and the path to the Excel file containing the customer orders.\n\nThe OpenAI GPT API is used to process the orders. Each row in the Excel file should have two columns: the first one for the customer's email address and the second one for their product order request in natural language.\n\nPlease note that this README does not provide any actual code or algorithms. It is a guide on how to setup and use the project. If you have any code snippets or files from this project, I would be happy to analyse those for you."

This can expose the key in system logs or to other users on the same system via commands like 'ps'.\n\n   **Solution**: Avoid passing sensitive data like API keys as command-line arguments. Instead, use environment variables or a secure configuration file.
